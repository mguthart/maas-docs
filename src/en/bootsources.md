# Boot images import configuration

The configuration for where a region downloads its images is defined by
a set of “sources”. Each “source” defines a Simplestreams repository
location (`url`) from which images can be downloaded
and a `keyring_filename` (or `keyring_data`) for validating index and image
signatures from that location. For each source, you can define a series
of filters (`selections`) specifying which images should be downloaded from
that source.

The following example use the MAAS CLI to list the boot sources and the
boot source selections. Assuming the CLI `PROFILE`
is the name of the profile under which you’re logged in to the server:

```no-highlight
 maas $PROFILE boot-sources read
    [
        {
            "url": "http://maas.ubuntu.com/images/ephemeral-v2/releases/",
            "keyring_data": "",
            "resource_uri": "<url omitted for readability>",
            "keyring_filename": "/usr/share/keyrings/ubuntu-cloudimage-keyring.gpg",
            "id": 1
        }
    ]

 maas $PROFILE boot-source-selections read 1
    [
        {
            "labels": [
                "release"
            ],
            "arches": [
                "amd64"
            ],
            "subarches": [
                "*"
            ],
            "release": "trusty",
            "id": 1,
            "resource_uri": "<url omitted for readability>"
        }
    ]

```

## Restricting the images being downloaded

Let’s say you want to add a previous LTS release to images being
downloaded. Starting from the configuration described above, you would
need to:

-   Add the “Precise” selection (the selection ‘1’ of the source ‘1’):

```bash
 maas $PROFILE boot-source-selection create 1 os="ubuntu" release="precise" arches="amd64" subarches="*" labels="*"
```

## Downloading the images from a different source

Let’s say you want to import the images from a different location. You
would need to to change the source’s url and keyring:

```no-highlight
maas $PROFILE boot-source update 1 url="http://custom.url" keyring_filename="" keyring_data@=./custom_keyring_file
    {
        "url": "http://custom.url/",
        "keyring_data": "<base64 encoded content of `custom_keyring_file`>",
        "resource_uri": "<url omitted for readability>",
        "keyring_filename": "",
        "id": 1
    }
```

## Adding a source


You can also add a new source:

```no-highlight
 maas $PROFILE boot-sources create url=http://my.url keyring_filename="" keyring_data@=./ custom_keyring_file
    {
        "url": "http://my.url/",
        "keyring_data": "ZW1wdHkK",
        "keyring_filename": "",
        "id": 2,
        "resource_uri": "<url omitted for readability>"
    }
```
Inside that newly created source (‘2’) you can add selections:

```no-highlight
 maas $PROFILE boot-source-selections create 2 os="ubuntu" release="trusty" arches="amd64" subarches="*" labels='*'
    {
        "labels": ["*"],
        "arches": ["amd64"],
        "subarches": ["*"],
        "release": "trusty",
        "id": 3,
        "resource_uri": "<url omitted for readability>"
    }
```

## Deleting a source


Let’s say you need to delete the newly added source.

To delete the source:

```bash
 maas $PROFILE boot-source delete 2
```
