# 1.9.0 (beta1)

## Major New Features

### Storage Configuration: LVM and RAID UI
Starting from MAAS 1.9.0 (beta1), MAAS now exposes custom storage configuration 
in the WebUI for the following:

 - **LVM:** Ability to easily create LVM.
 - **RAID:** Ability to create RAID 0, 1, 5, 6.


## Minor notable changes

### Fabric and subnet creation

Starting from MAAS 1.9.0 (beta1), MAAS now auto-creates multiple fabrics per 
physical interface connected to the Cluster Controller, and will correctly 
create subnetworks under each fabric, as well as VLAN’s if any VLAN interface 
on the Cluster Controller is preset.

## Known Problems & Workarounds

### CentOS fails to deploy
CentOS fails to deploy when deploying with an LVM storage layout. Provided that
LVM is the default storage layout, every CentOS deployment will fail, unless
this layout is changed to ‘Flat’ storage.

To work around the problem, the default storage layout can be changed from LVM
to Flat in MAAS’ Networks page, under Storage Layout section.

See bug #1499558 for more information.

### Fail to deploy (boot) with UEFI
MAAS will successfully instal in a UEFI system, however, after deployment it won’t boot onto the local disk. See bug 1510120 for more information.


# 1.9.0 (alpha5)

## Major New Features

### Storage Configuration: Partitioning and Bcache UI
Starting from MAAS 1.9.0 (alpha5), MAAS now exposes storage custom storage configuration in the WebUI for the following:

 - **Partitioning:** Ability to create and delete partitions.
 - **Bcache:** Ability to create cache sets and bcache devices, allowing multiple bcache devices to use the same cache set.

## Minor notable changes

### Warn users about missing power control tools
MAAS now warns users about the missing power control tools. Each MAAS power driver use a set of power tools that may or may not be installed by default. If these power tools are missing from the system, MAAS will warn users.

## Known Problems & Workarounds

### CentOS fails to deploy with LVM Storage layout
CentOS fails to deploy when deploying with an LVM storage layout. Provided that LVM is the default storage layout, every CentOS deployment will fail, unless this layout is changed to ‘Flat’ storage.

To work around the problem, the default storage layout can be changed from LVM to Flat in MAAS’ Networks page, under Storage Layout section.

See bug 1499558 for more information.

### Juju 1.24.6 bootstrap failure - Changing MAAS configured /etc/network/interfaces
Juju 1.24.6 (or less), assumes that it can manage the MAAS deployed node’s
network configuration. Juju changes /etc/network/interfaces and disables
bringing up eth0 on boot, to create a bridge to support LXC. However, provided
that MAAS / curtin now writes the node’s network configuration, Juju is unable
to successfully finish the creation of the bridge, but in the process, it
disables auto bring up of eth0.

Starting from Juju 1.24.7+, Juju has grown support to correctly manage a
`/etc/network/interfaces` that has been created after deployment with MAAS 1.9.0.

See bug 1494476 for more information.

# 1.9.0 (alpha4)

## Minor notable changes

- Various UI cosmetic fixes and improvements.
- Do not create MBR larger than 2TiB for LVM.
- Various concurrency fixes and improvements to robustness.


## Known Problems & Workarounds
CentOS fails to deploy with LVM Storage layout
CentOS fails to deploy when deploying with an LVM storage layout. Provided that LVM is the default storage layout, every CentOS deployment will fail, unless this layout is changed to ‘Flat’ storage.

To work around the problem, the default storage layout can be changed from LVM to Flat in MAAS’ Networks page, under Storage Layout section.

See bug 1499558 for more information.

Juju 1.24+ bootstrap failure - Changing MAAS configured /etc/network/interfaces
Juju 1.24+, by default, assumes that it can manage the MAAS deployed node’s network configuration. Juju changes /etc/network/interfaces and disables bringing up eth0 on boot, to create a bridge to support LXC. However, provided that MAAS / curtin now write the node’s network configuration, Juju is unable to successfully finish the creation of the bridge, but in the process, it disables auto bring up of eth0.

The machine will deploy successfully, however, after a reboot eth0 will never be brought back up due to the changes made by Juju. This will prevent Juju from SSH’ing into the machine and finishing the boostrap.

To prevent this from happening, disable-network-management: true needs to be used. Note that this will prevent the deployment of LXC containers as they have to DHCP.

See bug 1494476 for more information.

# 1.9.0 (alpha3)

## Major New Features

### Advanced Node Network Configuration UI
Starting from MAAS 1.9.0 (alpha3), MAAS can now do the Node’s Network configuration. Doing such configuration will result in having /etc/network/interfaces writen.

Advanced configuration UI includes:

 - Create VLAN interfaces.
 - Create bond interfaces.
 - Create Alias interfaces.
 - Change interface names.

### Subnetworks page UI
Starting from MAAS 1.9.0 (alpha3), MAAS can now show the new Subnets tab in the UI. This allow users to view:

 - Fabrics
 - Spaces
 - VLANs in fabrics.
 - Subnets in Spaces.

## Known Problems & Workarounds

### CentOS fails to deploy with LVM Storage layout
CentOS fails to deploy when deploying with an LVM storage layout. Provided that LVM is the default storage layout, every CentOS deployment will fail, unless this layout is changed to ‘Flat’ storage.

To work around the problem, the default storage layout can be changed from LVM to Flat in MAAS’ Networks page, under Storage Layout section.

### Juju 1.24+ bootstrap failure - Changing MAAS configured /etc/network/interfaces
Juju 1.24+, by default, assumes that it can manage the MAAS deployed node’s network configuration. Juju changes /etc/network/interfaces and disables bringing up eth0 on boot, to create a bridge to support LXC. However, provided that MAAS / curtin now write the node’s network configuration, Juju is unable to successfully finish the creation of the bridge, but in the process, it disables auto bring up of eth0.

The machine will deploy successfully, however, after a reboot eth0 will never be brought back up due to the changes made by Juju. This will prevent Juju from SSH’ing into the machine and finishing the boostrap.

To prevent this from happening, disable-network-management: true needs to be used. Note that this will prevent the deployment of LXC containers as they have to DHCP.

See bug 1494476 for more information.

# 1.9.0 (alpha2)

## Important announcements

### Installation by default configures /etc/network/interfaces
Starting from MAAS 1.9.0 (alpha2), all Ubuntu deployments will result with static network configurations. Users will be able to interact with the API to further configure interfaces.
Introduction to Fabrics, Spaces and Subnets introduces new Network API
With the introduction of the concepts of Fabrics, Spaces and Subnets starting from MAAS 1.9.0 (alpha2), MAAS also introduces new API’s for:

 - fabrics
 - spaces
 - subnets
 - vlans
 - fan-networks
MAAS 1.9.0 will continue to provide backwards compatibility with the old network API for reading purposes, but moving forward, users are required to use the new API to manipulate fabrics, spaces and subnets.

## Major New Features

### Advanced Node Network Configuration
Starting from MAAS 1.9.0 (alpha2), MAAS can now do the Node’s Network configuration. Doing such configuration will result in having /etc/network/interfaces writen.

Advanced configuration includes:

 - Assign subnets, fabrics, and IP to interfaces.
 - Create VLAN interfaces.
 - Create bond interfaces.
 - Change interface names.
 - Fabrics, Spaces, Subnets and Fan networks
 - Starting from MAAS 1.9.0 (alpha2), MAAS now supports the concept of Fabrics, Spaces, Subnets and FANS.

These new concepts replaces the old Network concepts from MAAS’ earlier versions. For more information, see Networking.

For more information about the API, see api.

### Curtin & cloud-init status updates
Starting from MAAS 1.9.0 (alpha2), curtin and cloud-init will now send messages to MAAS providing information regarding various of the actions taken. This information will be displayed in MAAS in the Node Event Log.

Note that this information is only available when using MAAS 1.9.0 and the latest version fo curtin. For cloud-init messages this information is only available when deploying Wily.

## Minor notable changes

### Commissioning Actions
MAAS now supports commissioning actions. These allow the user to specify how commissioning should behave in certain escenarios. The commissioning actions available are:

 - Enable SSH during commissioning
 - Keep machine ON after commissioning
 - Keep network configuration after commissioning
 - Keep storage configuration after commissioning
 - CentOS images can be imported automatically
 - CentOS Image (CentOS 6 and 7) can now be imported automatically from the MAAS Images page. These images are currently part of the daily streams.

In order to test this images, you need to use the daily image stream. This can be changed in the Settings page under Boot Images to http://maas.ubuntu.com/images/ephemeral-v2/daily/. Once changed, images can be imported from the MAAS Images page.

## Known Problems & Workarounds

### CentOS fails to deploy with LVM Storage layout
CentOS fails to deploy when deploying with an LVM storage layout. Provided that LVM is the default storage layout, every CentOS deployment will fail, unless this layout is changed to ‘Flat’ storage.

To work around the problem, the default storage layout can be changed from LVM to Flat in MAAS’ Networks page, under Storage Layout section.

See bug 1499558 for more information.

### Juju 1.24+ bootstrap failure - Changing MAAS configured /etc/network/interfaces
Juju 1.24+, by default, assumes that it can manage the MAAS deployed node’s network configuration. Juju changes /etc/network/interfaces and disables bringing up eth0 on boot, to create a bridge to support LXC. However, provided that MAAS / curtin now write the node’s network configuration, Juju is unable to successfully finish the creation of the bridge, but in the process, it disables auto bring up of eth0.

The machine will deploy successfully, however, after a reboot eth0 will never be brought back up due to the changes made by Juju. This will prevent Juju from SSH’ing into the machine and finishing the boostrap.

To prevent this from happening, disable-network-management: true needs to be used. Note that this will prevent the deployment of LXC containers as they have to DHCP.

See bug 1494476 for more information.

# 1.9.0 (alpha1)

## Important announcements

### LVM is now the default partitioning layout
Starting from MAAS 1.9, all of the deployments will result on having LVM configure for each of the machines. A Flat partitioning layout is not longer used by default. (This, however, can be changed in the MAAS Settings Page).
Re-commissioning required from VM’s with VirtIO devices
Starting from MAAS 1.9, storage partitioning and advance configuration is supported natively (see below). In order for MAAS to correctly map VirtIO devices in VM’s, these VM nodes need to be re-commissioned.

If not re-comissioned, MAAS will prevent the deployment until done so. Previously deployed nodes won’t be affected, but will also have to be re-commissioned if released.

## Major new features

### Storage Partitioning and Advanced Configuration
MAAS now natively supports Storage Partitioning and Advanced Configuration. This allows MAAS to deploy machines with different Storage Layouts, as well as different complext partitioning configurations. Storage support includes:

 - LVM
 - Bcache
 - Software Raid
 - Advanced partitioning

For more information refer to Storage.

## Minor notable changes

### Minimal Config Files for Daemons
Starting from MAAS 1.9, minimal configuration files have been introduced for both, the MAAS Region Controller and the MAAS Cluster Controller daemons.

The Region Controller (maas-regiond) has now dropped the usage of /etc/maas/maas_local_settings.py in favor of /etc/maas/regiond.conf. Available configuration options are now database_host, database_name, database_user, database_pass, maas_url. MAAS will attempt to migrate any configuration on upgrade, otherwise it will use sane defaults.
The Cluster Controller (maas-clusterd) has now dropped the usage of /etc/maas/pserv.yaml and /etc/maas/maas_cluster.conf in favor of /etc/maas/clusterd.conf. Available configuration options are now maas_url and cluster_uuid only. MAAS will attempt to migrate any configuration on upgrade, otherwise it will use sane defaults.

### HWE Kernels
MAAS now has a different approach to deploying Hardware Enablement Kernels. Start from MAAS 1.9, the HWE kernels are no longer coupled to subarchitectures of a machine. For each Ubuntu release, users will be able to select any of the available HWE kernels for such release, as well as set the minimum kernel the machine will be deployed with by default.

For more information, see Using hardware-enablement kernels.

### Python Power Drivers
Starting from MAAS 1.9, MAAS is moving away from using shell scripts templates for Power Drivers. These are being migrated to MAAS’ internal control as power drivers. Currently supported are APC, MSCM, MSFT OCS, SM15k, UCSM, Virsh, VMWare and IPMI.

Remaining Power Drivers include AMT, Fence CDU’s, Moonshot.

## Known Problems & Workarounds
Fail to deploy Trusty due to missing bcache-tools
In order to correctly perform storage partitioning in Trusty+, the new version of curtin used by MAAS requires bcache-tools to be installed. However, these tools are not available in Trusty, hence causing MAAS/curtin deployment failures when installing Trusty. An SRU in Ubuntu Trusty for these tools is already in progress.

To work around the problem, a curtin custom configuration to install bcache-tools can be used in /etc/maas/preseeds/curtin_userdata:

```
{{if node.get_distro_series() in ['trusty']}}
early_commands:
  add_repo: ["add-apt-repository", "-y", "ppa:maas-maintainers/experimental"]
{{endif}}
```

See bug 1449099 for more information.

### Fail to deploy LVM in Trusty
MAAS fail to deploy Ubuntu Trusty with a LVM Storage layout, as curtin will fail to perform the partitioning. See bug 1488632 for more information.

1.8.0
Important announcements
Region Controller now running on twisted.
The MAAS Region Controller is now running as a twisted daemon. It is no longer dependent on Apache in order to run. The MAAS Region controller is now controlled by maas-regiond upstart job or systemd unit. The maas-regiond daemon is available in port 5240.
Firewall ports for Region and Cluster controller communication
The communication between Region and Cluster controller is now limited to use the ports between 5250 and 5259. For all of those users who are using a remote cluster (not running on the same machine as the MAAS Region Controller), need to ensure that these ports are open in the firewall.
Major new features
Web UI Re-design
MAAS now includes a newly re-designed Web UI. The new Web UI features a new design and a lot of usability improvements. Some of the UI new features include:

Live Updating

The new UI now allows users to view the current status of the various nodes of MAAS in real-time and without having to manually refresh the browser.

Bulk Actions

Quickly select multiple nodes or devices and perform actions. If nodes or devices are not in a state where that action can be performed MAAS will alert you to the machines allowing you to modify your selection before performing the action.

Live Searching

View the matching nodes or devices as you search. Just type and the nodes will start to filter, no reloading or waiting for the page to load.

Better Filtering

Easily filter through the list of nodes and devices in MAAS to find the specific nodes that match your search. Examples:

All nodes that are Ready and have at least 2 disks:

status:Ready disks:2
All nodes that are not Ready:

status:!Ready
All nodes that have Failed to complete an action:

status:Failed
All nodes that are deployed but their power is off:

status:Deployed power:off
Node & Storage Tag Management

Administrators can now add and remove tags for both Machine and Storage. This is now possible via the Web UI from the Node Details page.

Add Chassis

A new Add Chassis feature has been added to the UI. This is an option of Add Hardware. This not only allows administrators to add machines that belong to a single chassis, but also allows administrators to add Virtual Machines for both KVM and VMWare based products.

Support for Devices
MAAS adds a new concept for a different type of machines, called Devices. Devices are machines that MAAS does not fully manage; this means that MAAS can not power manage nor properly control. Devices are machines in the Network that MAAS can provide network services for (DHCP/DNS), or can track for inventory.

Administrators can assign three different types of IP Address to a device:

External, which can be any IP address on the network.
Static, which can be selected manually or automatically, and belongs to Subnetwork that MAAS can control.
Dynamic, any IP address that is automatically assigned by MAAS via DHCP. MAAS will automatically create a DNS mapping for any of the IP addresses belonging to a Device.
Storage Discovery
Storage that is attached to a node in MAAS is now a first class citizen. Easily view and filter nodes based on the number of disks and the size of each disk attached to a node. Information retrieved from a storage device includes its name, model, serial, size, block size, and extra information that is applied to a storage device as a tag. MAAS will auto tag devices including tags for solid state device (ssd), rotary, rpm speed, and connected bus.
Twisted Daemons
The MAAS Region Controller no longer requires an Apache frontend. It is still used by default to be backward compatible, but the MAAS Region Controller is now a standalone Twisted process (the twisted daemon for the Cluster Controller, maas-clusterd, was introduced in MAAS 1.7). The MAAS Region Controller is now maas-regiond.

Starting from MAAS 1.8 the Region Controller and Cluster Controller are noq controlled only by two daemons. (maas-regiond and maas-clusterd respectively)

DB Isolation
Previously PostgreSQL was used in the default READ COMMITTED transaction isolation mode. It has now been increased to REPEATABLE READ. PostgreSQL thus provides extra support to ensure that changes in MAAS are logically consistent, a valuable aid in a busy distributed system.
VMware support
VMware products are now supported in MAAS. This allows MAAS to register all the Virtual Machines that the VMWare product is running (or a subset whose name matches a specified prefix), set them up to PXE boot, and configure them for power management.

This feature requires the python-pyvmomi package to be installed. (This is a suggested package, so be sure to use --install-suggests on your apt-get command line when installing the MAAS cluster, or install it manually.)

The following VMware products have been tested: vSphere Hypervisor 5.5, ESXi 5.5, and Workstation 11. This feature supports both i386 and amd64 virtual machines.

Minor notable changes
RPC Communication & Ports
RPC communication between the Region Controller and the Cluster Controller has now been limited to use the ports between 5250 and 5259, inclusive.
Discovered virtual machine names are imported into MAAS
When using the new Add Chassis functionality (or the probe_and_enlist API), virtual machines (VMs) imported into MAAS will now use the names defined within the Hypervisor as hostnames in MAAS. This feature works with KVM (virsh or PowerKVM) and VMWare VMs.

The names of the virtual machines will be converted into valid hostnames, if possible. For example, if a VM called Ubuntu 64-bit is imported, it will become ubuntu-64-bit.

Note that only the hostname portion of the name is used. For example, if a VM is called maas1.example.com, only the “mass1” portion of the name will be used as the node name. (The cluster configuration determines the remainder of the DNS name.)

Virtual machine boot order is now set automatically
When using the new Add Chassis functionality (or the probe_and_enlist API) to add KVM or VMware virtual machines, MAAS will automatically attempt to set each virtual machine’s boot order so that the network cards (PXE) are attempted first. (This increases the repeatability of VM deployments, because a VM whose boot order is incorrectly set may work once, but subsequently fail to deploy.)
Systemd Support
MAAS now supports systemd, allowing all of the MAAS daemons to run with Systemd, if the Ubuntu system is running systemd by default instead Upstart. These daemons include maas-regiond, maas-clusterd, maas-dhcpd, maas-dhcpd6, maas-proxy.
Upstart & Systemd improvements
Both Upstart Jobs and Systemd Units now run and supervise various instances of the maas-regiond in order to be able to effectively handle all requests.
Known Problems & Workarounds
Disk space is not reclaimed when MAAS boot images are superseded
Whenever new boot images are synced to maas-regiond, new large objects in the database are created for them, which may replace older versions of the same image (for the specified version/architecture combination). Unfortunately, the standard postgresql autovacuum does not remove large objects that are no longer used; a “full vacuum” is required for this. Therefore, a new command has been introduced which will run the appropriate postgresql vacuum command (See bug 1459876):

maas-region-admin db_vacuum_lobjects
This command should be run with care (ideally, during a scheduled maintenance period), since it could take a long time (on the order of minutes) if there are a large number of superseded images.

MAAS logs to maas.log.1 instead of maas.log
The /var/log/maas/maas.log is a rsyslog based log file, that gets rotated in the form of maas.log.1, maas.log.2.gz, etc. In one situation it has been seen that maas.log is empty, and rsyslog was sending logs to maas.log.1 instead. This has been identified as an issue in rsyslog rather than maas. See bug 1460678.

### Minor feature improvements

New CentOS Release support.  
Further to the work done in the 1.7.0 MAAS Release, MAAS now supports uploading various versions of CentOS. Previously MAAS would only officially support 6.5.

Power Monitoring for Seamicro 15000, Cisco UCS and HP Moonshot Chassis  
Further the work done in the 1.7.0 MAAS release, it now supports power query and monitoring for the Seamicro 15000 Chassis, the Cisco UCS Chassis Manager and the HP Moonshot Chassis Manager.

Node Listing Page and Node Event Log live refresh  
The Node Listing page and the Node Event Log now have live refresh every 10 seconds. This allows MAAS to display the latest node status and events without forcing a browser refresh.

IP Address Reservation  
The static IP address reservation API now has an optional "mac" parameter. Specifying a MAC address here will link the new static IP to that MAC address. A DHCP host map will be created for the MAC address. No other IPs may be reserved for that MAC address until the current one is released.

1.7.0
-----

### Important announcements

**Re-import your boot images**  
You must re-import your boot images, see below for details.

**Update Curtin preseed files**  
Two changes were made to Curtin preseed files that need your attention if you made any customisations:

-   The OS name must now appear in the filename. The new schema is shown here, each file pattern is tried in turn until a match is found:

    {prefix}\_{osystem}\_{node\_arch}\_{node\_subarch}\_{release}\_{node\_name} {prefix}\_{osystem}\_{node\_arch}\_{node\_subarch}\_{release} {prefix}\_{osystem}\_{node\_arch}\_{node\_subarch} {prefix}\_{osystem}\_{node\_arch} {prefix}\_{osystem} {prefix}

-   If you are modifying `/etc/network/interfaces` in the preseed, it must be moved so it is processed last in `late_commands` since MAAS now writes to this file itself as part of IPv6 setup. For example:

        late_commands:
          bonding_02: ["curtin", "in-target", "--", "wget", "-O", "/etc/network/interfaces", "http://[...snip...]"]

    must now look like this:

        late_commands:
          zz_write_ifaces: ["curtin", "in-target", "--", "wget", "-O", "/etc/network/interfaces", "http://[...snip...]"]

    The leading `zz` ensures the command sorts to the end of the `late_commands` list.

### Major new features

**Improved image downloading and reporting.**  
MAAS boot images are now downloaded centrally by the region controller and disseminated to all registered cluster controllers. This change includes a new web UI under the Images tab that allows the admin to select which images to import and shows the progress of the ongoing download. This completely replaces any file-based configuration that used to take place on cluster controllers. The cluster page now shows whether it has synchronised all the images from the region controller.

This process is also completely controllable using the API.

> **note**

> Unfortunately due to a format change in the way images are stored, it was not possible to migrate previously downloaded images to the new region storage. The cluster(s) will still be able to use the existing images, however the region controller will be unaware of them until an import is initiated. When the import is finished, the cluster(s) will remove older image resources.
>
> This means that the first thing to do after upgrading to 1.7 is go to the Images tab and re-import the images.

**Increased robustness.**  
A large amount of effort has been given to ensuring that MAAS remains robust in the face of adversity. An updated node state model has been implemented that takes into account more of the situations in which a node can be found including any failures at each stage.

When a node is getting deployed, it is now monitored to check that each stage is reached in a timely fashion; if it does not then it is marked as failed.

The core power driver was updated to check the state of the power on each node and is reported in the web UI and API. The core driver now also handles retries when changing the power state of hardware, removing the requirement that each power template handle it individually.

**RPC security.**  
As a step towards mutually verified TLS connections between MAAS's components, 1.7 introduces a simple shared-secret mechanism to authenticate the region with the clusters and vice-versa. For those clusters that run on the same machine as the region controller (which will account for most people), everything will continue to work without intervention. However, if you're running a cluster on a separate machine, you must install the secret:

1.  After upgrading the region controller, view /var/lib/maas/secret (it's text) and copy it.
2.  On each cluster, run:

    > sudo -u maas maas-provision install-shared-secret

    You'll be prompted for the secret; paste it in and press enter. It is a password prompt, so the secret will not be echoed back to you.

That's it; the upgraded cluster controller will find the secret without needing to be told.

**RPC connections.**  
Each cluster maintains a persistent connection to each region controller process that's running. The ports on which the region is listening are all high-numbered, and they are allocated randomly by the OS. In a future release of MAAS we will narrow this down. For now, each cluster controller needs unfiltered access to each machine in the region on all high-numbered TCP ports.

**Node event log.**  
For every major event on nodes, it is now logged in a node-specific log. This includes events such as power changes, deployments and any failures.

**IPv6.**  
It is now possible to deploy Ubuntu nodes that have IPv6 enabled. See ipv6 for more details.

**Removal of Celery and RabbitMQ.**  
While Celery was found to be very reliable it ultimately did not suit the project's requirements as it is a largely fire-and-forget mechanism. Additionally it was another moving part that caused some headaches for users and admins alike, so the decision was taken to remove it and implement a custom communications mechanism between the region controller and cluster controllers. The new mechanism is bidirectional and allowed the complex interactions to take place that are required as part of the robustness improvements.

Since a constant connection is maintained, as a side effect the web UI now shows whether each cluster is connected or not.

**Support for other OSes.**  
Non-Ubuntu OSes are fully supported now. This includes:  
-   Windows
-   Centos
-   SuSE

**Custom Images.**  
MAAS now supports the deployment of Custom Images. Custom images can be uploaded via the API. The usage of custom images allows the deployment of other Ubuntu Flavors, such as Ubuntu Desktop.

**maas-proxy.**  
MAAS now uses maas-proxy as the default proxy solution instead of squid-deb-proxy. On a fresh install, MAAS will use maas-proxy by default. On upgrades from previous releases, MAAS will install maas-proxy instead of squid-deb-proxy.

### Minor notable changes

**Better handling of networks.**  
All networks referred to by cluster interfaces are now automatically registered on the Network page. Any node network interfaces are automatically linked to the relevant Network.

> **note**

> Commissioning currently requires an IP address to be available for each network interface on a network that MAAS manages; this allows MAAS to auto-populate its networks database. In general you should use a well-sized network (/16 recommended if you will be using containers and VMs) and dynamic pool. If this feature risks causing IP exhaustion for your deployment and you do not need the auto-populate functionality, you can disable it by running the following command on your region controller:
>
>     sudo maas <profile> maas set-config name=enable_dhcp_discovery_on_unconfigured_interfaces value=False

**Improved logging.**  
A total overhaul of where logging is produced was undertaken, and now all the main events in MAAS are selectively reported to syslog with the "maas" prefix from both the region and cluster controllers alike. If MAAS is installed using the standard Ubuntu packaging, its syslog entries are redirected to /var/log/maas/maas.log.

On the clusters, pserv.log is now less chatty and contains only errors. On the region controller appservers, maas-django.log contains only appserver errors.

**Static IP selection.**  
The API was extended so that specific IPs can be pre-allocated for network interfaces on nodes and for user-allocated IPs.

**Pronounceable random hostnames.**  
The old auto-generated 5-letter names were replaced with a pseudo-random name that is produced from a dictionary giving names of the form 'adjective-noun'.

### Known Problems & Workarounds

**Upgrade issues**  
There may be upgrade issues for users currently on MAAS 1.5 and 1.6; while we have attempted to reproduce and address all the issues reported, some bugs remain inconclusive. We recommend a full, tested backup of the MAAS servers before attempting the upgrade to 1.7. If you do encounter issues, please file these and flag them to the attention of the MAAS team and we will address them in point-releases. See bugs [1381058](https://launchpad.net/bugs/1381058), [1382266](https://launchpad.net/bugs/1382266), [1379890](https://launchpad.net/bugs/1379890), [1379532](https://launchpad.net/bugs/1379532), and [1379144](https://launchpad.net/bugs/1379144).

**Split Region/Cluster set-ups**  
If you site your cluster on a separate host to the region, it needs a security key to be manually installed by running `maas-provision install-shared-secret` on the cluster host.

**Private boot streams**  
If you had private boot image stream information configured in MAAS 1.5 or 1.6, upgrading to 1.7 will not take that into account and it will need to be manually entered on the settings page in the MAAS UI (bug [1379890](https://launchpad.net/bugs/1379890))

**Concurrency issues**  
Concurrency issues expose us to races when simultaneous operations are triggered. This is the source of many hard to reproduce issues which will require us to change the default database isolation level. We intend to address this in the first point release of 1.7.

**Destroying a Juju environment**  
When attempting to "juju destroy" an environment, nodes must be in the DEPLOYED state; otherwise, the destroy will fail. You should wait for all in-progress actions on the MAAS cluster to conclude before issuing the command. (bug [1381619](https://launchpad.net/bugs/1381619))

**AMT power control**  
A few AMT-related issues remain, with workarounds:

> -   Commissioning NUC reboots instead of shutting down (bug [1368685](https://bugs.launchpad.net/maas/+bug/1368685)). There is [a workaround in the power template](https://bugs.launchpad.net/maas/+bug/1368685/comments/8)
> -   MAAS (amttool) cannot control AMT version \> 8. See [workaround described in bug 1331214](https://bugs.launchpad.net/maas/+bug/1331214/comments/18)
> -   AMT NUC stuck at boot prompt instead of powering down (no ACPI support in syslinux poweroff) (bug [1376716](https://bugs.launchpad.net/maas/+bug/1376716)). See the [ACPI-only workaround](https://bugs.launchpad.net/maas/+bug/1376716/comments/12)

**Disk wiping**  
If you enable disk wiping, juju destroy-environment may fail for you. The current workaround is to wait and re-issue the command. This will be fixed in future versions of MAAS & Juju. (bug [1386327](https://bugs.launchpad.net/maas/+bug/1386327))

**BIND with DNSSEC**  
If you are using BIND with a forwarder that uses DNSSEC and have not configured certificates, you will need to explicitly disable that feature in your BIND configuration (1384334)

**Boot source selections on the API**  
Use of API to change image selections can leave DB in a bad state (bug [1376812](https://bugs.launchpad.net/maas/+bug/1376812)). It can be fixed by issuing direct database updates.

**Disabling DNS**  
Disabling DNS may not work (bug [1383768](https://bugs.launchpad.net/maas/+bug/1383768))

**Stale DNS zone files**  
Stale DNS zone files may be left behind if the MAAS domainname is changed (bug [1383329](https://bugs.launchpad.net/maas/+bug/1383329))

### Bug fix update

-   Auto-link node MACs to Networks (LP: \#1341619) MAAS will now auto-create a Network from a cluster interface, and if an active lease exists for a node's MAC then it will be linked to that Network.

1.6.0
-----

Special notice:  
Cluster interfaces now have static IP ranges in order to give nodes stable IP addresses. You need to set the range in each interface to turn on this feature. See below for details.

### Major new features

IP addresses overhaul.  
This release contains a total reworking of IP address allocation. You can now define a separate "static" range in each cluster interface configuration that is separate from the DHCP server's dynamic range. Any node in use by a user will receive an IP address from the static range that is guaranteed not to change during its allocated lifetime. Previously, this was at the whim of the DHCP server despite MAAS placing host maps in its configuration.

Currently, dynamic IP addresses will continue to receive DNS entries so as to maintain backward compatibility with installations being upgraded from 1.5. However, this will be changed in a future release to only give DNS entries to static IPs.

You can also use the API to [reserve IP addresses](http://maas.ubuntu.com/docs1.6/api.html#ip-addresses) on a per-user basis.

Support for additional OSes.  
MAAS can now install operating systems other than Ubuntu on nodes. Preliminary beta support exists for CentOS and SuSE via the [Curtin](https://launchpad.net/curtin) "fast" installer. This has not been thoroughly tested yet and has been provided in case anyone finds this useful and is willing to help find and report bugs.

### Minor notable changes

DNS entries  
In 1.5 DNS entries for nodes were a CNAME record. As of 1.6, they are now all "A" records, which allows for reliable reverse look-ups.

Only nodes that are allocated to a user and started will receive "A" record entries. Unallocated nodes no longer have DNS entries.

Removal of bootresources.yaml  
The bootresources.yaml file, which had to be configured separately on each cluster controller, is no longer in use. Instead, the configuration for which images to download is now held by the region controller, and defaults to downloading all images for LTS releases. A [rudimentary API](http://maas.ubuntu.com/docs1.6/api.html#boot-source) is available to manipulate this configuration.

Fast installer is now the default  
Prevously, the slower Debian installer was used by default. Any newly-enlisted nodes will now use the newer [fast installer](https://launchpad.net/curtin). Existing nodes will keep the installer setting that they already have.

### Minor feature changes

Boot resource download changes.  
Further to the work done in the 1.5 (Ubuntu 14.04) release, MAAS no longer stores the configuration for downloading boot resources in `/etc/maas/bootresources.yaml`; this file is now obsolete. The sources list is now stored on the region controller and passed to the cluster controller when the job to download boot resources is started. It is still possible to pass a list of sources to `maas-import-pxe-files` when running the script manually.

(released in Ubuntu 14.04)

### Major new features

Advanced Networking.  
MAAS will now support multiple managed network interfaces on a single cluster. It will track networks (including tagged VLANs) to which each node is able to connect and provides this information in the API. API clients may also use networking information in acquisition constraints when asking for a new node allocation.

See The full Networking documentation \<networks\>.

Zones.  
A Zone is an arbitrary grouping of nodes. MAAS now allows admins to define Zones, and place in them any of the region's nodes. Once defined, API clients can use the zone name as acquisition constraints for new node allocations.

See physical-zones for more detail.

Hardware Enablement Kernels.  
MAAS is now able to fetch and use hardware enablement kernels which allow kernels for newer Ubuntu releases to be used on older releases.

See hardware-enablement-kernels

### Minor feature changes

Maas-Test.  
A new project [maas-test](https://launchpad.net/maas-test/) was created to put a piece of hardware through MAAS's test suite to see if it's suitable for use in MAAS, and optionally report the results to a bug in Launchpad's maas-test project.

IPMI improvements.  
Many improvements were made to IPMI handling, including better detection during enlistment. Many IPMI-based systems that previously failed to work with MAAS will now work correctly.

Completion of image downloading changes.  
Further to the work done in the 1.4 (Ubuntu 13.10) release, MAAS now uses indexed "simplestreams" data published by Canonical to fetch not only the ephemeral images, but now also the kernels and ramdisks. The resource download configuration is now in a new file `/etc/maas/bootresources.yaml` on each cluster controller. All previous configuration files for image downloads are now obsolete. The new file will be pre-configured based on images that are already present on the cluster.

This change also enables end-users to provide their own simplestreams data and thusly their own custom images.

Cluster-driven hardware availability.  
When adding or editing node hardware in the region controller, MAAS will contact the relevant cluster controller to validate the node's settings. As of release, the only validation made is the architecture and the power settings. Available architectures are based on which images have been imported on the cluster. In the future, this will enable new cluster controllers to be added that contain drivers for new hardware without restarting the region controller.

Seamicro hardware.  
MAAS now supports the Seamicro 15000 hardware for power control and API-based enlistment.

AMT.  
MAAS now supports power control using [Intel AMT](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/intel-active-management-technology.html).

DNS forwarders.  
In MAAS's settings it's now possible to configure an upstream DNS, which will be set in the bind daemon's 'forwarders' option.

Foreign DHCP servers.  
MAAS detects and shows you if any other DHCP servers are active on the networks that are on the cluster controller.

Commissioning Results.  
A node's commissioning results are now shown in the UI.

Renamed commands.  
`maas` is renamed to `maas-region-admin`. `maas-cli` is now just `maas`.

1.4
---

(released in Ubuntu 13.10)

### Major new features

LLDP collection.  
MAAS now collects LLDP data on each node during its commissioning cycle. The router to which the node is connected will have its MAC address parsed out of the data and made available for using as a placement constraint (passing connected\_to or not\_connected\_to to the acquire() API call), or you can define tags using expressions such as `//lldp:chassis/lldp:id[@type="mac"]/text() = "20:4e:7f:94:2e:10"` which would tag nodes with a router using that MAC address.

New faster installer for nodes.  
MAAS will now make use of the new [Curtin](https://launchpad.net/curtin) installer which is much quicker than the old Debian Installer process. Typically an installation now takes a couple of minutes instead of upwards of 10 minutes. To have a node use the faster installer, add the `use-fastpath-installer` tag to it, or click the "Use the fast installer" button on the node page.

More extensible templates for DHCP, power control, PXE and DNS.  
Templates supplied for these activities are now all in their own template file that is customisable by the user. The files now generally live under /etc/maas/ rather than embedded in the code tree itself.

### Minor feature changes

Reworked ephemeral downloading  
While there is no end-user visible change, the ephemeral image download process is now driven by a data stream published by Canonical at <http://maas.ubuntu.com/images/streams>. In the future this will allow end users to use their own customised images by creating their own stream. The configuration for this is now also part of `pserv.yaml`, obsoleting the maas\_import\_ephemerals configuration file. The config will be auto-migrated on the first run of the `maas-import-ephemerals` script.

Improved maas-cli support  
Users can now manage their SSH keys and API credentials via the maas-cli tool.

Django 1.5  
MAAS is updated to work with Django 1.5

HP Moonshot Systems support.  
MAAS can now manage HP Moonshot Systems as any other hardware. However, in order for MAAS to power manage these systems, it requires the user to manually specify the iLO credentials before the enlistment process begins. This can be done in the `maas_moonshot_autodetect.py` template under `/etc/maas/templates/commissioning-user-data/snippets/`.
