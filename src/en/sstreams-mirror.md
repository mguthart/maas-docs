# Local Mirroring of Boot Images

Boot images are delivered to MAAS via the simplestreams protocol. It is
useful in some situations, such as testing, to mirror the images locally
so that you don’t need to repeatedly pull them down over a slower
Internet link.

First, install the required packages on the host where you wish to store
the mirrored images:

```bash
sudo apt-get install simplestreams ubuntu-cloudimage-keyring apache2
```

Now you can pull the images over using the mirroring tools for
simplestreams. This example gets the daily trusty (14.04) and precise
(12.04) images for the amd64/generic and amd64/hwe-t architectures:

```bash
sudo sstream-mirror --keyring=/usr/share/keyrings/ubuntu-cloudimage-keyring.gpg http://maas.ubuntu.com/images/ephemeral-v2/daily/ /var/www/html/maas/images/ephemeral-v2/daily 'arch=amd64' 'subarch~(generic|hwe-t)' 'release~(trusty|precise)' --max=1
```

This may take a while as hundreds of megabytes will be downloaded.

The images will be written to the local disk and you can verify their
presence by browsing to
`http://<server>/maas/images/ephemeral-v2/daily/streams/v1/index.sjson` 
(replace `<server>` with your own server’s name).

It is a good idea to configure a `cron` job to
repeat this import on a regular basis to keep your mirror up-to-date.

## Configuring MAAS to use the local mirror

You can do this using the API or the web UI. To do this via the API you
can use the `maas` (see [Command Line Interface](maascli.html)) command, logged
in as the admin user:

```bash
maas <profile> boot-sources create url=http://<server>keyring_filename=/usr/share/keyrings/ubuntu-cloudimage-keyring.gpg
```

And then initiate the download with:

```bash
maas <profile> boot-resources import
```

See [Boot images import configuration](bootsources.html) for more
detail.

In the web UI, browse to the Settings tab as the admin user and scroll
down to the “Boot Images” section. There you will find input boxes for
the Sync URL and the keyring path, which should be set as the values in
the API example above.

The import is initiated by browsing to the Images tab and following the
instructions on that page.
