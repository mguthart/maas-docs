MAAS Troubleshooting[¶](#maas-troubleshooting "Permalink to this headline")
===========================================================================

Some parts of MAAS may still be a little confusing, and sometimes you
might be trying to do things that are just plain impossible. This
section covers some of the most commonly encountered problems and tries
its best to make them gone.

[Nodes hang on “Commissioning”](#id1)[¶](#nodes-hang-on-commissioning "Permalink to this headline")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Possible Cause: Timing issues[¶](#possible-cause-timing-issues "Permalink to this headline")

Various parts of MAAS rely on OAuth to negotiate a connection to nodes.
If the current time reported by the hardware clock on your node differs
significantly from that on the MAAS server, the connection will not be
made.

**SOLUTION:** Check that the hardware clocks are consistent, and if
necessary, adjust them. This can usually be done from within the system
BIOS, without needing to install an OS

### Possible Cause: Network drivers[¶](#possible-cause-network-drivers "Permalink to this headline")

Sometimes the hardware can boot from PXE, but fail to load correct
drivers when booting the received image. This is sometimes the case when
no open source drivers are available for the network hardware.

**SOLUTION:** The best fix for this problem is to install a
Linux-friendly network adapter. It *is* theoretically possible to modify
the boot image to include proprietary drivers, but it is not a
straightforward task.

[Nodes fail to PXE boot](#id2)[¶](#nodes-fail-to-pxe-boot "Permalink to this headline")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Possible Cause: Using an incorrectly configured VM[¶](#possible-cause-using-an-incorrectly-configured-vm "Permalink to this headline")

Some Virtual Machine setups include emulation of network hardware that
does not support PXE booting, and in most setups, you will need to
explicitly set up the VM to boot via PXE.

**SOLUTION**: Consult the VM docs for details of PXE booting.

### Possible Cause: DHCP conflict[¶](#possible-cause-dhcp-conflict "Permalink to this headline")

If you are using MAAS in a setup with an existing DHCP, *DO NOT SET UP
THE MAAS DHCP SERVER* as this will cause no end of confusion to the rest
of your network and most likely won’t discover any nodes either.

**SOLUTION**: You will need to configure your existing DHCP server to
point to the MAAS server.

[Can’t log in to node](#id3)[¶](#can-t-log-in-to-node "Permalink to this headline")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sometimes you may wish to login directly to a node on your system. If
you have set up Juju and MAAS, the attached nodes will automatically
receive existing ssh keys and sets up ssh on the node to authenticate
via key, so you can just login with no password from the server. There
is also an option in the MAAS web interface to add new ssh keys to the
nodes (via Preferences in the drop down menu which appears when clicking
your username in the top-right of the page).

[Forgot MAAS superuser password](#id4)[¶](#forgot-maas-superuser-password "Permalink to this headline")
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As long as you have sudo privileges, this is not a disaster. You can use
the `maas`{.docutils .literal} command to change the password for the
MAAS superuser on the MAAS server:

> `sudo maas changepassword root`{.docutils .literal}

[Need to reconfigure server IP address](#id5)[¶](#need-to-reconfigure-server-ip-address "Permalink to this headline")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you made a mistake during setup or you just need to reconfigure your
MAAS server, you can simply run the setup again:

> `sudo dpkg-reconfigure maas-region-controller`{.docutils .literal}

[Can’t find MAAS webpage](#id6)[¶](#can-t-find-maas-webpage "Permalink to this headline")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The default webpage is located at `http://<hostname>/MAAS/`{.docutils
.literal}. If you can’t access it, there are a few things to try:

> 1.  Check that the webserver is running - By default the web interface
>     uses Apache, which runs under the service name *apache2*. To check
>     it, on the MAAS server box you can run
>     `sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 status`{.docutils .literal}.
> 2.  Check that the hostname is correct - It may seem obvious, but
>     check that the hostname is being resolved properly. Try running a
>     browser (even a text mode one like lynx) on the same box as the
>     MAAS server and navigating to the page. If that doesn’t work, try
>     `http://127.0.0.1/MAAS/`{.docutils .literal}, which will always
>     point at the local server.
> 3.  If you are still getting “404 - Page not found” errors, check that
>     the MAAS web interface has been installed in the right place.
>     There should be a file present called /usr/share/maas/maas/urls.py

[Debugging ephemeral image](#id7)[¶](#debugging-ephemeral-image "Permalink to this headline")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Backdoor (add a login) to ephemeral images[¶](#backdoor-add-a-login-to-ephemeral-images "Permalink to this headline")

If you cannot login to an instance, you might have to “backdoor it” in
order to see what is going wrong. Scott Moser wrote a simple utility
that injects a user and password into an image. Here’s how to add a
‘backdoor’ user with a password to your images:

    sudo apt-get install --assume-yes bzr
    bzr branch lp:~maas-maintainers/maas/backdoor-image backdoor-image

    imgs=$(echo /var/lib/maas/boot-resources/*/*/*/*/*/*/root-image)
    for img in $imgs; do
        [ -f "$img.dist" ] || sudo cp -a --sparse=always $img $img.dist
    done

    for img in $imgs; do
        sudo ./backdoor-image/backdoor-image -v --user=backdoor --password-auth --password=ubuntu $img
    done

### Inside the ephemeral image[¶](#inside-the-ephemeral-image "Permalink to this headline")

Important files for debugging (Someone is likely to ask you for these
things to help debug):

    /var/log/cloud-init.log
    /var/log/boot.log
    /var/log/cloud-init-output.log

After enlistment or commissioning, the user-data from maas instructs the
system to power off. To stop that from happening, you can just create a
file in /tmp:

    touch /tmp/block-poweroff

### MAAS credentials[¶](#maas-credentials "Permalink to this headline")

MAAS credentials can be found in 2 places:

1.  from the cmdline you’ll see a `url=`{.docutils .literal} or
    `cloud-config-url=`{.docutils .literal} parameter. You can get the
    cloud-config from that url, which will have credentials:

        $ sed -n 's,.*url=\([^ ]*\).*,\1,p' /proc/cmdline
        http://10.55.60.194/MAAS/metadata/latest/enlist-preseed/?op=get_enlist_preseed

2.  from `/etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/91_kernel_cmdline_url`{.docutils
    .literal}. The file was pulled from `url=`{.docutils .literal}
    parameter by cloud-init:

        $ sudo cat /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/91_kernel_cmdline

### MAAS datasource[¶](#maas-datasource "Permalink to this headline")

The cloud-init datasource for MAAS can be invoked as a ‘main’ for
debugging purposes. To do so, you need to know the url for the MAAS
datasource and a config file that contains credentials:

    cfg=$(echo /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/*_cmdline_url.cfg)
    echo $cfg /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/91_kernel_cmdline_url.cfg

Now get the metadata\_url from there:

    url=$(sudo awk '$1 == "metadata_url:" { print $2 }' $cfg)
    echo $url http://10.55.60.194/MAAS/metadata/enlist

Invoke the client
/usr/share/pyshared/cloudinit/sources/DataSourceMAAS.py The client has
–help Usage also, but here is an example of how to use it:

    $ maasds="/usr/share/pyshared/cloudinit/sources/DataSourceMAAS.py"
    $ sudo python $maasds --config=$cfg get $url
    == http://10.55.60.194/MAAS/metadata/enlist ==
    2012-03-01
    latest
    $ sudo python $maasds --config=$cfg get $url/latest/meta-data/local-hostname
    maas-enlisting-node
